# ReverseCuthillMcKee

## Implemented for course 'Parallel & Distributed Systems' of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki

Authors: Gonidelis Ioannis & Zikopis Evangelos

## Description

Sparse graph matrix reordering using ReverseCuthillMcKee algorithm and OpenMP library.

## How to execute code

```bash
cd ReverseCuthillMckee
make
cd bin
./sequential or ./parallel
```
### Optional Functions

Our implementation offers optional functionality.

- If you want to calculate the initial and final bandwidhts uncomment Lines X-Y and Lines X-Y.
- If you want to save the input sparse matrix uncomment Lines X-Y.
- If you want to generate and save the output sparse matrix uncomment Lines X-Y. This step could be time consuming for big matrices.
