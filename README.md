## Description

Sparse graph matrix reordering using ReverseCuthillMcKee algorithm and OpenMP library.

## How to execute code

```bash
cd ReverseCuthillMckee
make sequential
cd src
./sequential
```

At the beginning the program asks from the user to insert the size and density of the matrix. The sparse matrix is generated randomly. After the execution  the input and output matrices are stored in /sparseMatrices directory in .csv files.
